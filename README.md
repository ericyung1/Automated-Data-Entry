# Automated-Data-Entry
The purpose of this python project is to automate data entry into a website given an Excel spreadsheet with hundreds of rows, which would be too time-consuming to manually input. Inside the Excel spreadsheet is a list of first names, last names, phone numbers, zip codes, birthdays, and email addresses. Using the Selenium and Pandas libraries for web automation and the ability to read Excel spreadsheets in python, this code has the ability to send keys into blank spaces onto a survey form, click confirmation buttons, and select desired items on a dropdown menu.
